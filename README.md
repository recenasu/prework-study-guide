# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was built to help organize notes for the coding boot camp class. Now the notes are easily accessible and grouped on a single webpage. While building this, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JS at a very basic level.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The webpage contains notes broken down by topic. Navigating to the DevTools console you can see the results of a JavaScript that randomly picks a topic to study first. The JavaScript executes each time the page is loaded.
